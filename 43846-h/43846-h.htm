<p class="title1">THE<br />
SEER OF SLABSIDES</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>This title, "The Seer of Slabsides," does
not quite fit John Burroughs&mdash;the Burroughs
I knew. He was a see-er. A
lover of nature, he watched the ways
of bird and beast; a lover of life, he
thought out and wrought out a serene
human philosophy that made him teacher
and interpreter of the simple and the
near at hand rather than of such things
as are hidden and far off. He was altogether
human; a poet, not a prophet; a
great lover of the earth, of his portion of
it in New York State, and of everything
and everybody dwelling there with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
He has added volumes to the area of
New York State, and peopled them with
immortal folk&mdash;little folk, bees, bluebirds,
speckled trout, and wild strawberries.
He was chiefly concerned with
living at Slabsides, or at Woodchuck
Lodge, and with writing what he lived.
He loved much, observed and interpreted
much, speculated a little, but
dreamed none at all. "The Lover of
Woodchuck Lodge" I might have
called him, rather than "The Seer of
Slabsides."</p>

<p>Pietro, the sculptor, has made him resting
upon a boulder, his arm across his forehead,
as his eyes, shielded from the sun,
peer steadily into the future and the faraway.
I sat with the old naturalist on
this same boulder. It was in October, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
they laid him beside it the following
April, on his eighty-fourth birthday. I
watched him shield his eyes with his
arm, as the sculptor has made him, and
gaze far away over the valley to the rolling
hills against the sky, where his look
lingered, sadly, wearily, for a moment at
their vaunting youth and beauty; then
coming instantly back to the field below
us, he said: "This field is as full of
woodchucks as it was eighty years ago.
I caught one right here yesterday. How
eternally interesting life is! I've studied
the woodchuck all my life, and there's
no getting to the bottom of him."</p>

<p>He knew, as I knew, that he might
never rest against this rock again. He
had played upon it as a child. He now
sleeps beside it. But so interesting was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the simplest, the most familiar thing to
him, that the long, long twilight, already
filling the valley and creeping up toward
him, still gave him a chance, as we sat
there, to watch the woodchuck slipping
from his burrow. Had I been the sculptor,
I should have made the old naturalist
lying flat on the round of that rock,
his white beard a patch of lichen, his
eyes peering from under his slouch hat
over the top of the boulder at something
near at hand&mdash;at the woodchuck feeding
below in the pasture.</p>

<p>He was the simplest man I ever knew,
simpler than a child; for children are
often self-conscious and uninterested,
whereas Burroughs's interest and curiosity
grew with the years, and his directness,
his spontaneity, his instant pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and his constant joy in living, his utter
naturalness and naïveté amounted to
genius. They were his genius&mdash;and a
stumbling-block to many a reader. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Similia
similibus curantur</i>, or a thief to catch
a thief, as we say; and it certainly requires
such a degree of simplicity to understand
Burroughs as few of us possess.</p>

<p>Not every author improves upon personal
acquaintance, but an actual visit
with Burroughs seems almost necessary
for the right approach to his books.
Matter and manner, the virtues and
faults of his writings, the very things he
did not write about, are all explained in
the presence of a man of eighty-three
who brings home a woodchuck from the
field for dinner, and saves its pelt for a
winter coat. And with me at dinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
that day were other guests, a lover of
Whitman from Bolton, England, a distinguished
American artist, and others.</p>

<p>The country road, hardly more than
a farm lane, shies up close to Woodchuck
Lodge as it goes by. Here on the
vine-grown porch was the cot of the
old naturalist, as close to the road as it
could get. Burroughs loved those remote
ancestral hills, and all the little folk who
inhabitated them with him. He was as
retiring and shy as a song sparrow&mdash;who
nests in the bushes, and sings from
the fence stake. No man loved his fellow-man
more than Burroughs. Here
in his cot he could watch the stars come
out upon the mountain-tops and see the
fires of dawn kindle where the stars had
shone, and here, too, he could see every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
passer-by and, without rising, for he had
need to rest, he could reach out a hand
of welcome to all who stopped on their
journey past.</p>

<p>And everybody stopped. If he had no
fresh woodchuck to serve them, he would
have one out of a can, for no less in his
home than in his heart had he made
provision for the coming guest. The
stores of the village were far away, but
there was no lack of canned woodchuck
and hospitality in the Lodge. Few men
have had more friends or a wider range
of friends than Burroughs. And months
later, as I sat looking over the strange
medley of them gathered at his funeral,
I wondered at them, and asked myself
what was it in this simple, childlike
man, this lover of the bluebird, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
earth on his breast and the sky on his
back, that drew these great men and little
children about him. He was elemental.
He kept his soul. And through
the press men crowded up to touch him,
and the virtue that went out from him
restored to them their souls&mdash;their bluebird
with the earth on its breast and the
sky, the blue sky, on its back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>And this same restoration I find in his
books. John Burroughs began that long
line of books by writing an essay for the
"Atlantic Monthly," entitled "Expression,"&mdash;"a
somewhat Emersonian Expression,"
says its author,&mdash;which was
printed in the "Atlantic" for November,
1860, sixty-one years ago; and in
each of those sixty-one years he has not
failed to publish one or more essays here
where "Expression" led the way.</p>

<p>Sixty-one years are not threescore and
ten, being nine years short. Many men
have lived and wrought for more than
threescore and ten years; but Burroughs's
"Atlantic" years are unique. To write
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
without a break for sixty-one years, and
keep one's eye undimmed, one's natural
force unabated, one's soul unfagged and
as fresh as dawn, is of itself a great human
achievement.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks before his death he
sent me a copy of the last book that he
should see through the press, and who
shall say that "Accepting the Universe"
lacks anything of the vigor or finish or
freshness found in his earliest books? It
is philosophical, theological, indeed, in
matter, and rather controversial in style;
its theme is like that of "The Light of
Day," a theme his pen was ever touching,
but nowhere with more largeness
and beauty (and inconsistency) than here.
For Burroughs, though deeply religious,
was a poor theologian. He hated cant, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
feared the very vocabulary of theology as
he feared the dark. Life was remarkably
single with Burroughs and all of a piece.
In a little diary, one of the earliest he
has left us, he asks, under date of October
8, 1860 (a month before his first essay
appeared in the "Atlantic"):</p>

<p>"Is there no design of analogy in this
Universe? Are these striking resemblances
that wed remote parts, these
family traits that break out all through
nature and that show the unity of the
creating mind, the work of chance?
Are these resemblances and mutual answerings
of part to part that human intelligence
sees and recognizes only in its
most exalted moments&mdash;when its vision
is clearest&mdash;a mere accident?"</p>

<p>That was written in pencil filling a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
whole page of his diary for 1860. On
page 220 of "Accepting the Universe,"
published sixty-one years later, and only
a short time before his death, we find
this attempted answer:</p>

<p>"So, when we ask, Is there design in
Nature? we must make clear what part
or phase of Nature we refer to. Can we
say that the cosmos as a whole shows
any design in our human sense of the
word? I think not. The Eternal has no
purpose that our language can compass.
There can be neither center nor circumference
to the Infinite. The distribution
of land and water on the globe cannot be
the result of design any more than can
the shapes of the hills and mountains, or
Saturn's rings, or Jupiter's moons. The
circular forms and orbits of the universe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
must be the result of the laws of matter
and force that prevail in celestial mechanics;
this is not a final solution of
the riddle, but is as near as we can come
to it. One question stands on another
question, and that on another, and so on,
and the bottom question we can never
reach and formulate."</p>

<p>It is a beautiful illustration of the continuity,
the oneness of this singularly
simple life; and it is as good an illustration
of how the vigor of his youth steadies
into a maturity of strength with age,
which in many a late essay&mdash;as in "The
Long Road," for instance&mdash;lifts one
and bears one down the unmeasured
reaches of geologic time as none of his
earlier chapters do.</p>

<p>Many men have written more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
John Burroughs. His twenty-five volumes
are perhaps nothing remarkable for
sixty years of steady writing. But it
is remarkable to come up to four and
eighty with one book just off the press,
two more books in manuscript to appear
after the light has failed; for there is still
a book of miscellaneous papers, and some
studies on Emerson and Thoreau yet to
be published.</p>

<p>And I think it a rather remarkable
lot of books, beginning with "Wake-Robin,"
running down through the titles,
with "Winter Sunshine," "Birds
and Poets," "Locusts and Wild Honey,"
"Pepacton," "Fresh Fields," "Signs
and Seasons," "Riverby," "Far and
Near," "Ways of Nature," "Leaf and
Tendril," "The Summit of the Years,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
"Time and Change," "The Breath of
Life," "Under the Apple-Trees," and
"Field and Study," to "Accepting the
Universe," for these books deal very
largely with nature, and by themselves
constitute the largest, most significant
group of nature-books that have come,
perhaps, from any single pen.</p>

<p>These sixteen or seventeen volumes
are John Burroughs's most characteristic
and important work. If he has done any
desirable thing, made any real contribution
to American literature, that contribution
will be found among these books.
His other books are eminently worth
while: there is reverent, honest thinking
in his religious essays, a creedless but an
absolute and joyous faith; there is simple
and exquisite feeling in his poems;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
close analysis and an unmitigatedness
wholly Whitmanesque in his interpretation
of Whitman; and no saner, happier
criticism anywhere than in his "Literary
Values." There are many other excellent
critics, however, many poets and
religious writers, many other excellent
nature-writers, too; but is there any other
who has written so much upon the ways
of nature as they parallel and cross the
ways of men, upon so great a variety of
nature's forms and expressions, and done
it with such abiding love, with such
truth and charm?</p>

<p>Yet such a comparison is beyond
proof, except in the least of the literary
values&mdash;mere quantity; and it may be
with literature as with merchandise: the
larger the cask the greater the tare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Charm? Is not charm that which I
chance to like, or <em>you</em> chance to like?
Others have written of nature with as
much love and truth as has John Burroughs,
and each with his own peculiar
charm: Audubon, with the spell of wild
places and the thrill of fresh wonder;
Traherne, with the ecstasy of the religious
mystic; Gilbert White, with the
sweetness of the evening and the morning;
Thoreau, with the heat of noonday;
Jefferies, with just a touch of twilight
shadowing all his pages. We want
them severally as they are; John Burroughs
as he is, neither wandering "lonely
as a cloud" in search of poems, nor
skulking in the sedges along the banks
of the Guaso Nyero looking for lions.
We want him at Slabsides, near his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
celery fields, or at Woodchuck Lodge
overlooking the high fields that run down
from the sky into Montgomery Valley.
And whatever the literary quality of our
other nature-writers, no one of them has
come any nearer than John Burroughs to
that difficult ideal&mdash;a union of thought
and form, no more to be separated than
the heart and the bark of a live tree.</p>

<p>Take John Burroughs's work as a
whole, and it is beyond dispute the most
complete, the most revealing, of all our
outdoor literature. His pages lie open
like the surface of a pond, sensitive to
every wind, or calm as the sky, holding
the clouds and the distant blue, and the
dragon-fly, stiff-winged, and pinned to
the golden knob of a spatter-dock.</p>

<p>All outdoor existence, all outdoor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
phenomena, are deeply interesting to
him. There is scarcely a form of outdoor
life, scarcely a piece of landscape,
or natural occurrence characteristic of
the Eastern States, which has not been
dealt with suggestively in his pages: the
rabbit under his porch, the paleozoic pebble
along his path, the salt breeze borne
inland by the Hudson, the whirl of a snow-storm,
the work of the honey bees, the
procession of the seasons over Slabsides,
even the abundant soil out of which he
and his grapes grew and which, "incorruptible
and undefiled," he calls divine.</p>

<p>He devotes an entire chapter to the
bluebird, a chapter to the fox, one to
the apple, another to the wild strawberry.
The individual, the particular
thing, is always of particular interest to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
him. But so is its habitat, the whole of
its environment. He sees the gem, not
cut and set in a ring, but rough in the
mine, where it glitters on the hand of
nature, and glitters all the more that it
is worn in the dark. Naturally John Burroughs
has written much about the
birds; yet he is not an ornithologist.
His theme has not been this or that, but
nature in its totality, as it is held within
the circle of his horizon, as it surrounds,
supports, and quickens him.</p>

<p>That nature does support and quicken
the spiritual of him, no less than the
physical, is the inspiration of his writing
and the final comment it requires.
Whether the universe was shaped from
chaos with man as its end, is a question
of real concern to John Burroughs, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
of less concern to him than the problem
of shaping himself to the universe, of
living as long as he can upon a world so
perfectly adapted to life, if only one be
physically and spiritually adaptable. To
take the earth as one finds it, to plant
one's self in it, to plant one's roof-tree
in it, to till it, to understand it and the
laws which govern it, and the Perfection
which created it, and to love it all&mdash;this
is the heart of John Burroughs's religion,
the pith of his philosophy, the conclusion
of his books.</p>

<p>But if a perfect place for the fit, how
hard a place is this world for the lazy,
the ignorant, the stubborn, the weak,
the physically and spiritually ill! So
hard that a torpid liver is almost a mortal
handicap, the stars in their courses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
fighting against the bilious to defeat
them, to drive them to take exercise, to
a copious drinking of water, to a knowledge
of burdock and calomel&mdash;to obedience
and understanding.</p>

<p>Underlying all of John Burroughs's
thought and feeling, framing every one
of his books, is a deep sense of the perfection
of nature, the sharing of which
is physical life, the understanding of
which is spiritual life, is knowledge of
God himself, in some part of His perfection.
"I cannot tell what the simple
apparition of the earth and sky mean to
me; I think that at rare intervals one
sees that they have an immense spiritual
meaning, altogether unspeakable,
and that they are the great helps, after
all." How the world was made&mdash;its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
geology, its biology&mdash;is the great question,
for its answer is poetry and religion
and life itself. John Burroughs was
serenely sure as to how the world was
made; the theological speculation as to
<em>why</em> it was made, he answered by growing
small fruits on it, living upon it,
writing about it.</p>

<p>Temperamentally John Burroughs was
an optimist, as vocationally he was a
writer, and avocationally a vine-dresser.
He planted and expected to gather&mdash;grapes
from his grapevines, books from
his book-vines, years, satisfactions, sorrows,
joys, all that was due him.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
And what is it that was due him?
Everything; everything essential; as
everything essential is due the pine-tree,
the prairie, the very planet. Is not
this earth a star? Are not the prairie,
the pine-tree, and man the dust of stars?
each a part of the other? all parts of
one whole&mdash;a universe, round, rolling,
without beginning, without end, without
flaw, without lack, a universe self-sustained,
perfect?</p>

<div class="line i1">  And what is mine shall know my face.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>John Burroughs came naturally by such
a view of nature and its consequent optimism.
It was due partly to his having
been born and brought up on a farm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
where he had what was due him from
the start. Such birth and bringing-up is
the natural right of every boy. To know
and to do the primitive, the elemental;
to go barefoot, to drive the cows, to
fish, and to go to school with not too
many books, but with "plenty of real
things"&mdash;these are nominated in every
boy's bond.</p>

<p class="center">Serene, I fold my hands and wait,</p>

<p>is the poem of a childhood on the farm,
and the poem of a manhood on the farm,
in spite of the critic who says:</p>

<p>"We have never ceased to wonder
that this friend of the birds, this kindly
interpreter of nature in all her moods,
was born and brought up on a farm; it
was in that smiling country watered by
the east branch of the Delaware. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
man, as a rule, knows less about the
colors, songs, and habits of birds, and is
more indifferent to natural scenery than
the man born to the soil, who delves in
it and breathes its odors. Contact with
it and laborious days seem to deaden his
faculties of observation and deprive him
of all sympathy with nature."</p>

<p>During the days when the deadening
might have occurred, John Burroughs
was teaching school. Then he became
a United States bank examiner, and only
after that returned to the country&mdash;to
Riverby and Slabsides, and Woodchuck
Lodge,&mdash;to live out the rest of his years,
years as full of life and books as his vines
along the Hudson are full of life and
grapes.</p>

<p>Could it be otherwise? If men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
grapes are of the same divine dust, should
they not grow according to the same
divine laws? Here in the vineyard along
the Hudson, John Burroughs planted
himself in planting his vines, and every
trellis that he set has become his own
support and stay. The very clearing of
the land for his vineyard was a preparation
of himself physically and morally
for a more fruitful life.</p>

<p>"Before the snow was off in March,"
he says in "Literary Values," "we set
to work under-draining the moist and
springy places. My health and spirits
improved daily. I seemed to be under-draining
my own life and carrying off
the stagnant water, as well as that of
the land." And so he was. There are
other means of doing it&mdash;taking drugs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
playing golf, walking the streets; but
surely the advantages and the poetry are
all in favor of the vineyard. And how
much fitter a place the vineyard to mellow
and ripen life, than a city roof of
tarry pebbles and tin!</p>

<p>Though necessarily personal and subjective,
John Burroughs's writing is entirely
free from self-exploitation and
confession. There are pages scattered
here and there dealing briefly and frankly
with his own natural history, but our
thanks are due to John Burroughs that
he never made a business of watching
himself. Once he was inveigled by a
magazine editor into doing "An Egotistical
Chapter," wherein we find him
as a boy of sixteen reading essays, and
capable at that age of feeding for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
whole year upon Dr. Johnson! Then
we find him reading Whipple's essays,
and the early outdoor papers of Higginson;
and later, at twenty-three, settling
down with Emerson's essays, and getting
one of his own into the "Atlantic
Monthly."</p>

<p>How early his own began to come to
him!</p>

<p>That first essay in the "Atlantic"
was followed by a number of outdoor
sketches in the New York "Leader"&mdash;written,
Burroughs says, "mainly to
break the spell of Emerson's influence
and get upon ground of my own." He
succeeded in both purposes; and a large
and exceedingly fertile piece of ground
it proved to be, too, this which he got
upon! Already the young writer had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
chosen his field and his crop. The out-of-doors
has been largely his literary
material, as the essay has been largely
his literary form, ever since. He has
done other things&mdash;volumes of literary
studies and criticisms; but his theme
from first to last has been the Great Book
of Nature, a page of which, here and
there, he has tried to read to us.</p>

<p>Burroughs's work, in outdoor literature,
is a distinct species, with new
and well-marked characteristics. He is
the nature-writer, to be distinguished
from the naturalist in Gilbert White, the
mystic in Traherne, the philosopher in
Emerson, the preacher, poet, critic in
Thoreau, the humorist in Charles Dudley
Warner. As we now know the nature-writer
we come upon him for the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
time in John Burroughs. Such credit
might have gone to Thomas Wentworth
Higginson, had he not been something
else before he was a lover of nature&mdash;of
letters first, then of flowers, carrying his
library into the fields; whereas Burroughs
brings the fields into the library.
The essay whose matter is nature, whose
moral is human, whose manner is strictly
literary, belongs to John Burroughs. His
work is distinguished by this threefold
and <em>even</em> emphasis. In almost every other
of our early outdoor writers either the
naturalist or the moralist or the stylist
holds the pen.</p>

<p>Early or late, this or that, good outdoor
writing must be marked, first, by
fidelity to fact; and, secondly, by sincerity
of expression. Like qualities mark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
all good literature; but they are themselves
the <em>very</em> literature of nature. When
we take up a nature-book we ask (and it
was Burroughs who taught us to ask),
"Is the record true? Is the writing
honest?"</p>

<p>In these many volumes by John Burroughs
there are many observations, and
it is more than likely that some of them
may be wrong, but it is not possible
that any of them could be mixed with
observations that Burroughs knows he
never made. If Burroughs has written
a line of sham natural history, which line
is it? In a preface to "Wake-Robin,"
the author says his readers have sometimes
complained that they do not see
the things which he sees in the woods;
but I doubt if there ever was a reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
who suspected John Burroughs of not
seeing the things.</p>

<p>His reply to these complaints is significant,
being in no manner a defense,
but an exquisite explanation, instead, of
the difference between the nature which
anybody may see in the woods and the
nature that every individual writer, because
he is a writer, and an individual,
must put into his book: a difference like
that between the sweet-water gathered
by the bee from the flowers and the drop
of acid-stung honey deposited by the bee
in the comb. The sweet-water undergoes
a chemical change in being brought
to the hive, as the wild nature undergoes
a literary change&mdash;by the addition
of the writer's self to the nature, while
with the sweet-water it is by the addition
of the bee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
One must be able to walk to an editorial
office and back, and all the way
walk humbly with his theme, as Burroughs
ever does&mdash;not entirely forgetful
of himself, nor of me (because he
has invited me along); but I must be
quiet and not disturb the fishing&mdash;if we
go by way of a trout-stream.</p>

<p>True to the facts, Burroughs is a
great deal more than scientific, for he
loves the things&mdash;the birds, hills, seasons&mdash;as
well as the truths about them;
and true to himself, he is not by any means
a simple countryman who has never seen
the city, a natural idyl, who lisps in
books and essays, because the essays
come. He is fully aware of the thing
he wants to do, and by his own confession
has a due amount of trouble shaping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
his raw material into finished literary
form. He is quite in another class from
the authors of "The Complete Angler"
and "New England's Rarities Discovered."
In Isaak Walton, to quote Leslie
Stephen, "<i>a happy combination of circumstances</i>
has provided us with a true country
idyl, fresh and racy from the soil,
not consciously constructed by the most
skillful artistic hand."</p>

<p>Now the skillful artistic hand is
everywhere seen in John Burroughs.
What writer in these days could expect
happy combinations of circumstances
in sufficient numbers for so many volumes?</p>

<p>But being an idyl, when you come to
think of it, is not the result of a happy
combination of circumstances, but rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of stars&mdash;of horoscope. You are born an
idyl or you are not, and where and when
you live has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Who would look for a true country
idyl to-day in the city of Philadelphia?
Yet one came out of there yesterday,
and lies here open before me, on the
table. It is a slender volume, called
"With the Birds, An Affectionate Study,"
by Caroline Eliza Hyde. The author is
discussing the general subject of nomenclature
and animal distribution, and says:</p>

<p>"When the Deluge covered the then
known face of the earth, the birds were
drowned with every other living thing,
except those that Noah, commanded
by God, took two by two into the Ark.</p>

<p>"When I reflect deeply and earnestly
about the Ark, as every one should,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
thoughts crowd my mind with an irresistible
force."</p>

<p>[And they crowd my mind, too.]</p>

<p>"Noah and his family had preserved
the names of the birds given them by
Adam. This is assured, for Noah sent a
raven and a dove out to see if the waters
had abated, and we have birds of that
name now. Nothing was known of our
part of the globe, so these birds must
have remained in the Holy Land for
centuries. We do not hear of them until
America was discovered....</p>

<p>"Bats come from Sur. They are very
black mouse-like birds, and disagreeable....
The bobolink is not mentioned in
the Bible, but it is doubtless a primitive
bird. The cock that crows too early in
the morning ... can hardly be classed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
with the song-birds. The name of the
humming-bird is not mentioned in the
Bible, but as there is nothing new under
the sun, he is probably a primitive bird."</p>

<p>Burroughs would have agreed that the
humming-bird is probably a primitive
bird; and also that this is a true idyl,
and that he could not write a true idyl
if he tried. No one could write like that
by trying. And what has any happy
combination of circumstances to do with
it? No, a book essentially is only a personality
in type, and he who would not
be frustrated of his hope to write a true
idyl must himself be born a true idyl.
A fine Miltonic saying!</p>

<p>John Burroughs was not an idyl, but an
essayist, with a love for books only second
to his love for nature; a watcher in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
the woods, a tiller of the soil, a reader,
critic, thinker, poet, whose chief business
these sixty years has been the interpretation
of the out-of-doors.</p>

<p>Upon him as interpreter and observer,
certain of his books, "Ways of Nature"
and "Leaf and Tendril," are an interesting
comment.</p>

<p>Truth does not always make good
literature, not when it is stranger than
fiction, as it often is; and the writer who
sticks to the truth of nature must sometimes
do it at the cost of purely literary
ends. Have I sacrificed truth to literature?
asks Burroughs of his books.
Have I seen in nature the things that
are there, or the strange man-things,
the "winged creeping things which have
four feet," and which were an abomination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
to the ancient Hebrews, but which
the readers of modern nature-writing
do greedily devour&mdash;are these the things
I have seen? And for an answer he sets
about a reëxamination of all he has
written, from "Wake-Robin" to "Far
and Near," hoping "that the result of
the discussion or threshing will not be
to make the reader love the animals less,
but rather to love the truth more."</p>

<p>But the result, as embodied in "Ways
of Nature" and in "Leaf and Tendril,"
is quite the opposite, I fear; for these
two volumes are more scientific in tone
than any of his other work; and it is
the mission, not of science, but of literature,
to quicken our love for animals,
even for truth. Science only adds to the
truth. Yet here, in spite of himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Burroughs is more the writer, more the
interpreter, than the investigator. He
is constantly forgetting his scientific thesis,
as, for instance, in the account of
his neighbor's errant cow. He succeeds
finally, however, in reducing her fairly
well to a mechanical piece of beef acting
to vegetable stimuli upon a nerve
ganglion located somewhere in the region
between her horns and her tail.</p>

<p>Now, all this is valuable, and the use
made of it is laudable, but would we not
rather have the account than the cow,
especially from Burroughs? Certainly,
because to us it is the <em>account</em> that he
has come to stand for. And so, if we
do not love his scientific animals more,
and his scientific findings more, we
shall, I think, love all his other books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
more; for we see now that, from the
beginning, he has regarded the facts of
nature as the solid substance of his books,
to be kept as free from fancy and from
false report, as his interpretation of them
is to be kept free from all exaggeration
and cant.</p>

<p>Here, then, are a score of volumes of
honest seeing, honest feeling, honest
reporting. Such honesty of itself may
not make good nature-literature, but
without such honesty there can be no
good nature-literature.</p>

<p>Nature-literature is not less than the
truth, but more; how much more,
Burroughs himself suggests to us in a
passage about his literary habits.</p>

<p>"For my part," he says, "I can never
interview Nature in the reporter fashion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
I must camp and tramp with her to get
any good, and what I get I absorb through
my emotions rather than consciously
gather through my intellect.... An
experience must lie in my mind a certain
time before I can put it upon paper&mdash;say
from three to six months. If there
is anything in it, it will ripen and mellow
by that time. I rarely take any
notes, and I have a very poor memory,
but rely upon the affinity of my mind
for a certain order of truths or observations.
What is mine will stick to me,
and what is not will drop off. We who
write about Nature pick out, I suspect,
only the rare moments when we have
had glimpses of her, and make much of
them. Our lives are dull, our minds
crusted over with rubbish like those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
other people. Then writing about Nature,
or about most other subjects, is an
expansive process; we are under the law
of evolution; we grow the germ into
the tree; a little original observation goes
a good way." For "when you go to
Nature, bring us good science or else
good literature, and not a mere inventory
of what you have seen. One demonstrates,
the other interprets."</p>

<p>Careful as John Burroughs has been
with his facts, so careful as often to bring
us excellent science, he yet has left us
no inventory of the out-of-doors. His
work is literature; he is not a demonstrator,
but an interpreter, an expositor
who is true to the text and true to the
whole of the context.</p>

<p>Our pleasure in Burroughs as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
interpreter comes as much from his
wholesome good sense, from his balance
and sanity, I think, as from the assurance
of his sincerity. Free from pose
and cant and deception, he is free also
from bias and strain. There is something
ordinary, normal, reasonable, companionable,
about him; an even tenor to
all his ways, a deliberateness, naturalness
to all his paths, as if they might have
been made originally by the cows. So
they were.</p>

<p>If Burroughs were to start from
my door for a tramp over these small
Hingham hills he would cross the trout-brook
by my neighbor's stone bridge,
and, nibbling a spear of peppermint on
the way, would follow the lane and the
cow-paths across the pasture. Thoreau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
would pick out the deepest hole in the
brook and try to swim across; he would
leap the stone walls of the lane, cut a
bee-line through the pasture, and drop,
for his first look at the landscape, to
the bottom of the pit in the seam-face
granite quarry. Here he would pull out his
notebook and a gnarly wild apple from
his pocket, and, intensely, critically,
chemically, devouring said apple, make
note in the book that the apples of Eden
were flat, the apples of Sodom bitter, but
this wild, tough, wretched, impossible
apple of the Hingham hills united all
ambrosial essences in its striking odor
of squash-bugs.</p>

<p>Burroughs takes us along with him.
Thoreau comes upon us in the woods&mdash;jumps
out at us from behind some bush,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
with a "<em>Scat!</em>" Burroughs brings us
home in time for tea; Thoreau leaves
us tangled up in the briars.</p>

<p>It won't hurt us to be jumped at now
and then and told to "<em>scat!</em>" It won't
hurt us to be digged by the briars. It is
good for us, otherwise we might forget
that <em>we</em> are beneath our clothes. It is
good for us and highly diverting,&mdash;and
highly irritating too.</p>

<p>But Thoreau stands alone. "Walden
Pond" is one of America's certain contributions
to the world's great books.</p>

<p>For my part, when I take up an outdoor
book I am glad if there is quiet in
it, and fragrance, and something of the
saneness and sweetness of the sky. Not
that I always want sweet skies. It is
ninety-eight degrees in the shade, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
three weeks since there fell a drop of
rain. I could sing like a robin for a sizzling,
crackling thunder-shower&mdash;less
for the sizzling and crackling than for
the shower. Thoreau is a succession of
showers&mdash;"tempests"; his pages are
sheet-lightning, electrifying, purifying,
illuminating, but not altogether conducive
to peace. "Walden Pond" is something
more than a nature book. There
is a clear sky to most of Burroughs's
pages, a rural landscape, wide, gently
rolling, with cattle standing here and
there beneath the trees.</p>

<p>Burroughs's natural history is entirely
natural, his philosophy entirely reasonable,
his religion and ethics very much
of the kind we wish our minister and
our neighbor might possess; and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
manner of writing is so unaffected that
we feel we could write in such a manner
ourselves. Only we cannot.</p>

<p>Since the time he can be said to have
"led" a life, Burroughs has led a literary
life; that is to say, nothing has been
allowed to interfere with his writing;
yet the writing has not been allowed
to interfere with a quiet successful business&mdash;with
his raising of grapes.</p>

<p>He has a study and a vineyard.</p>

<p>Not many men ought to live by the
pen alone. A steady diet of inspiration
and words is hard on the literary health.
The writing should be varied with some
good, wholesome work, actual hard work
for the hands; not so much work, perhaps,
as one would find in an eighteen-acre
vineyard; yet John Burroughs's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
eighteen acres certainly proved to be no
check&mdash;rather, indeed, a stimulus&mdash;to
his writing. He seems to have gathered
a volume out of every acre; and
he seems to have put a good acre into
every volume. "Fresh Fields" is the
name of one of the volumes, "Leaf and
Tendril" of another; but the freshness
of his fields, the leaves and the tendrils
of his vineyard, enter into them all.
The grapes of the vineyard are in them
also.</p>

<p>Here is a growth of books out of the
soil, books that have been trimmed,
trained, sprayed, and kept free from rot.
Such books may not be altogether according
to the public taste; they will
keep, however, until the public acquires
a better taste. Sound, ripe, fresh, early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and late, a full crop! Has the vineyard
anything to do with it?</p>

<p>It is not every farmer who should go
to writing, nor every writer who should
go to farming; but there is a mighty
waste of academic literature, of premature,
precocious, lily-handed literature,
of chicken-licken literature, because the
writers do not know a spade when they
see one, would not call it a spade if they
knew. Those writers need to do less
writing and more farming, more real
work with their soft hands in partnership
with the elemental forces of nature, or
in comradeship with average elemental
men&mdash;the only species extant of the
quality to make writing worth while.</p>

<p>John Burroughs had this labor, this
partnership, this comradeship. His writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
is seasoned and sane. It is ripe, and
yet as fresh as green corn with the dew
in the silk. You have eaten corn on the
cob just from the stalk and steamed in
its own husk? Green corn that <em>is</em> corn,
that has all its milk and sugar and flavor,
is corn on the cob, and in the husk&mdash;is
cob and kernel and husk&mdash;not a
stripped ear that is cooked into the
kitchen air.</p>

<p>Literature is too often stripped of its
human husk, and cut from its human
cob: the man gone, the writer left; the
substance gone, the style left&mdash;corn that
tastes as much like corn as it tastes like
puffed rice&mdash;which tastes like nothing
at all. There is the sweetness of the
husk, the flavor of the cob, the substance
of the uncut corn to John Burroughs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
There is no lack of cob and husk to
Thoreau&mdash;of shell and hull, one should
say, for he is more like a green walnut
than an ear of green corn. Thoreau is
very human, a whole man; but he is
almost as much a tree, and a mountain,
and a pond, and a spell of weather, and
a state of morals. He is the author of
"Walden," and nobody else in the world
is that; he is a lover of Nature, as ardent
a lover as ever eloped with her; he is a
lover of men, too, loving them with an
intensity that hates them bag and baggage;
he is poetical, prophetic, paradoxical,
and utterly impossible.</p>

<p>But he knew it. Born in Concord,
under the transcendental stars, at a time
when Delphic sayings and philosophy,
romance and poetry ran wild in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
gardens where Bouncing-Bet and Wayward
Charlie now run wild, Thoreau
knew that he was touched, and that all
his neighbors were touched, and sought
asylum at Walden. But Walden was not
distant enough. If John Burroughs in
Roxbury, New York, found it necessary
to take to the woods in order to escape
from Emerson, then Thoreau should
have gone to Chicago, or to Xamiltepec.</p>

<p>It is the strain, in Thoreau, that
wearies us; his sweating among the
stumps and woodchucks, for a bean crop
netting him eight dollars, seventy-one
and one half cents. But such beans!
Beans with minds and souls! Yet, for
baking, plain beans are better than these
transcendental beans, because your transcendental
beans are always baked without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
pork. A family man, however, cannot
contemplate that piddling patch with
any patience, even though he have a
taste for literature as real as his taste for
beans. It is better to watch John Burroughs
pruning his grapevines for a crop
to net him one thousand, three hundred
and twenty-five dollars, and <em>no</em> cents,
and no half-cents. Here were eighteen
acres to be cultivated, whose fruit was
to be picked, shipped, and sold in the
New York markets at a profit&mdash;a
profit plainly felt in John Burroughs's
books.</p>

<p>Reading what I have just said, as it
appeared in the "Atlantic" for November,
1910, Burroughs wrote in the course
of a letter to me:</p>

<p>"I feel like scolding you a little for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
disparaging Thoreau for my benefit.
Thoreau is nearer the stars than I am.
I may be more human, but he is as certainly
more divine. His moral and ethical
value I think is much greater, and
he has a heroic quality that I cannot
approach."</p>

<p>Perhaps no truer word will ever be
said of these two men than that; and
certainly no more generous word was
ever spoken by one great writer of another,
his nearest rival. I have not, nor
would I, disparage Thoreau for Burroughs's
benefit. Thoreau dwells apart.
He is long past all disparagement.
"Walden Pond" and "The Week," if
not the most challenging, most original
books in American literature, are, with
Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Emerson's "Essays," among those books.</p>

<p>Thoreau and Burroughs had almost
nothing in common except their love
of nature, and in that they were farther
apart than in anything else, Thoreau
searching by night and day in all wild
places for his lost horse and hound while
Burroughs quietly worshiped, as his rural
divinity, the ruminating cow.</p>

<p>The most worthy qualities of good
writing are those least noticeable&mdash;negative
qualities of honesty, directness,
sincerity, euphony; noticeable only by
their absence. Yet in John Burroughs
they amounted to a positive charm. Indeed,
are not these same negative qualities
the very substance of good style?
Such style as is had by a pair of pruning-shears,
as is embodied in the exquisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
lines of a flying swallow&mdash;the style that
is perfect, purposeful adaptability?</p>

<p>But there is more than efficiency to John
Burroughs's style; there are strengths and
graces existing in and for themselves.
Here is a naturalist who has studied the
art of writing. "What little merit my
style has," he declares, "is the result of
much study and discipline." And whose
style, if it be style at all, is not the result
of much study and discipline? Flourish,
fine-writing, wordiness, obscurity, and
cant are exorcised in no other way; and
as for the "limpidness, sweetness, freshness,"
which John Burroughs says should
characterize outdoor writing, and which
do characterize his writing, how else
than by study and discipline shall they
be obtained?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Outdoor literature, no less than other
types of literature, is both form and matter;
the two are mutually dependent, inseparably
one; but the writer is most
faithful to the form when he is most
careful of the matter. It makes a vast
difference whether his interest is absorbed
by what he has to say, or by the possible
ways he may say it. If John Burroughs
wrote in his shirt-sleeves, as a recent
critic says he did, it was because he went
about his writing as he went about his
vineyarding&mdash;for grapes, for thoughts,
and not to see how pretty he could make
a paragraph look, or into what fantastic
form he could train a vine. The vine is
lovely in itself&mdash;if it bear fruit.</p>

<p>And so is language. Take John Burroughs's
manner in any of its moods: its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
store of single, sufficient words, for instance,
especially the homely, rugged
words and idioms, and the flavor they
give, is second to the work they do; or
take his use of figures&mdash;when he speaks
of De Quincey's "discursive, roundabout
style, herding his thoughts as a collie
dog herds sheep"&mdash;and unexpected,
vivid, apt as they are, they are even more
effective. One is often caught up by the
poetry of these essays and borne aloft,
but never on a gale of words; the lift
and sweep are genuine emotion and
thought.</p>

<p>As an essayist&mdash;as a nature-writer I
ought to say&mdash;John Burroughs's literary
care is perhaps nowhere so plainly seen
as in the simple architecture of his essay
plans, in their balance and finish, a quality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
that distinguishes him from others
of the craft, and that neither gift nor
chance could so invariably supply. The
common fault of outdoor books is the
catalogue&mdash;raw data, notes. There are
paragraphs of notes in John Burroughs,
volumes of them in Thoreau. The average
nature-writer sees not too much of
nature, but knows all too little of literary
values; he sees everything, gets a meaning
out of nothing; writes it all down;
and gives us what he sees, which is precisely
what everybody may see; whereas,
we want also what he thinks and feels.
Some of our present writers do nothing
but feel and divine and fathom&mdash;the
animal psychologists, whatever they are.
The bulk of nature-writing, however,
is journalistic, done on the spot, into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
notebook, as were the journals of Thoreau&mdash;fragmentary,
yet with Thoreau
often exquisite fragments&mdash;bits of old
stained glass, unleaded, and lacking unity
and design.</p>

<p>No such fault can be found with John
Burroughs. He went pencilless into the
woods, and waited before writing until his
return home, until time had elapsed for
the multitudinous details of the trip to
blur and blend, leaving only the dominant
facts and impressions for his pen.
Every part of his work is of selected
stock, as free from knots and seams and
sapwood as a piece of old-growth pine.
There is plan, proportion, integrity to
his essays&mdash;the naturalist living faithfully
up to a sensitive literary conscience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
John Burroughs was a good but not a
great naturalist, as Audubon and Gray
were great naturalists. His claim (and
Audubon's in part) upon us is literary.
He was a watcher in the woods; he made
a few pleasant excursions into the primeval
wilderness, leaving his gun at home,
and his camera, too, thank Heaven! He
broke out no new trail, discovered no
new animal, no new thing. But he saw
all the old, uncommon things, saw them
oftener, watched them longer, through
more seasons, than any other writer of
our out-of-doors; and though he discovered
no new thing, yet he made
discoveries, volumes of them&mdash;contributions
largely to our stock of literature,
and to our store of love for the earth,
and to our joy in living upon it. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
turned a little of the universe into literature;
translated a portion of the earth
into human language; restored to us our
garden here eastward in Eden&mdash;apple-tree
and all.</p>

<p>For a real taste of fruity literature,
try John Burroughs's chapter on "The
Apple." Try Thoreau's, too,&mdash;if you
are partial to squash-bugs. There are
chapters in John Burroughs, such as "Is
it going to Rain?" "A River View,"
"A Snow-Storm," which seem to me as
perfect, in their way, as anything that
has ever been done&mdash;single, simple,
beautiful in form, and deeply significant;
the storm being a piece of fine description,
of whirling snow across a geologic
landscape, distant, and as dark as eternity;
the whole wintry picture lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
and warmed at the end by a glowing
touch of human life:</p>

<p>"We love the sight of the brown and
ruddy earth; it is the color of life, while
a snow-covered plain is the face of
death; yet snow is but the mark of life-giving
rain; it, too, is the friend of man&mdash;the
tender, sculpturesque, immaculate,
warming, fertilizing snow."</p>

<p>There are many texts in these volumes,
many themes; and in them all
there is one real message: that this is a
good world to live in; that these are
good men and women to live with; that
life is good, here and now, and altogether
worth living.</p>

<p>It was in October that I last saw him&mdash;at
Woodchuck Lodge. November 22 he
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I neglected to make any apologies for
the long letter I wrote you the other
day. I promise not to do so again. I am
enclosing an old notebook of mine, filled
with all sorts of jottings as you will see.
I send it for a keepsake.</p>

<p>We are off for California to-morrow.
Hope to be there in early December.
We leave Chicago on the 29th. My
address there will be <i>La Jolla</i>, San Diego.
Good luck to you and yours.</p>

<p class="left40">Always your friend</p>

<p class="left42"><span class="smcap">John Burroughs</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
He kept his promise too too well. This
was the last letter I ever had from him.</p>

<p>He dreaded that California journey.
San Diego is a long, long way from
Woodchuck Lodge when one is nearing
eighty-four. Dr. Barrus and two of her
nieces made the trip with him, Henry
Ford, out of his friendship, meeting the
expenses of the winter sojourn. But California
had no cure for the winter that
had at last fallen upon the old naturalist.
Sickness, and longing for home, and
other ills befell him. He was in a hospital
for many days. But visitors came
to see him as usual; he went among the
schools speaking; nor was his pen idle&mdash;not
yet; one of the last things, if not
the very last he wrote for publication,
being a vigorous protest against free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
verse, called "The Reds of Literature."
But all the while he was thinking of
home, and planning for his birthday
party at the Lodge back on the ancestral
farm.</p>

<p>We celebrated it. He was there.
But he did not know. On the third
day of April, his eighty-fourth birthday,
followed by a few of his friends,
mourned by all the nation, he was laid
to rest in the hill pasture, beside the
boulder on which he had played as a
child, and where only a few months before
he had taken me to see the glory
of hill and sky that had been his lifelong
theme, and that were to be his
sleep forever.</p>

<p>He died on the train that was bringing
him back from California, his last desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
not quite fulfilled. He was a wholly
human man; and an utterly simple man;
and so true to himself, that his last words,
uttered on the speeding train, expressed
and completed his whole life with singular
beauty: "How far are we from
home," he asked,&mdash;and the light failed;
and the train sped on as if there were
need of hurry now!</p>
